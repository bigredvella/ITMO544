Use this repository to pull your website.
You need to create two web pages from scratch using html5 standard code
On the first page print your names and the course section you are in and add a link to the s3 buckek where you placed the picture of yourself
Add a url link to the second page
The second page must include your name and a link to the image of the Scarlet Hawk I provided last week (this hawk image will be uploaded directly to your git account in a directory called images - just like in the class example)
The second page needs a link returning to the home page.
Name this html file page2.html
